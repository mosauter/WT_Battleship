        Our project Battleship is a bit different reproduction of the classic game battleship.<br>

                Battleship is a two-player game on a rotating basis.
                (KI not implemented yet) The game field is a 10x10 matrix, where every player can place 5 ships.
                The first ship has the length of 2 and the size of each following is increased by 1.
                When both players placed their ships the game starts. Now the players shoots once alternately, until all ships of one player are destroyed.
                The player which first hits all ships, is the winner and the game will end.
